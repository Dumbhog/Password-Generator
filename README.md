Welcome to my python password generator! It currently creates passwords in the format: (adjective)(symbol)(animal)(number)

This was inspired by the google passwords in my school, and that's why I made it so you have the option to create a single password or many, (choose up to 1000) since I thought about if you needed to create a large amount of passwords for any particular reason.

Update V1.1:
The program now does not break when a string is entered as a number input thanks to a try statement.

Controls:

Create password/continue: Enter
Go back(break loop): B
Exit: Any other key
 
Using the password generator:

 The programme will give you the option to enter "S" (to create a single password) or "M" (to create multiple passwords). After selecting which mode to use, you will create your password(s) ("M" mode will ask you how many you want to create) and then you shall have the option to go back into the previous menu, exit the programme, or continue creating passwords!


Future features to add:
User-defined password criteria?
