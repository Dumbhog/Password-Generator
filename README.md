Welcome to my python password generator! It currently creates passwords in the format: (adjective)(symbol)(animal)(number) with the option to make them between 10 and 17 characters long.

This was inspired by the google passwords in my school, and that's why I made it so you have the option to create a single password or many, (choose up to 1000) since I thought about if you needed to create a large amount of passwords for any particular reason.

Update V2.0:
Rewrote the program to include the option to make passowrds between 10 and 17 characters long via lists of animal names of differing lengths.
Various other changes to the main loop including adding additional support for exiting and going back (breaking).

Controls:

Create password/continue: Enter
Go back(break loop): B
Exit: E (Or often any other key)
 
Using the password generator:

 The program will ask you how many password you would like to generate, then it will give you the option to enter "S" (to create a single password) or "M" (to create multiple passwords). After selecting which mode to use, you will create your password(s) ("M" mode will ask you how many you want to create) and then you will select the length of the passwords desired again, or also exit the programme.


Future features to add:
User-defined password criteria - Selection for symbols, numbers, etc.
